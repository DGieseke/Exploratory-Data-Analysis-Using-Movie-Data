# Analysis of Movie Industry Data

*Seamus Walsh and Daniel Gieseke  |  May 12, 2023*

Media companies in the entertainment industry hold a wealth of movie data waiting to be analyzed.  These large amounts of movie industry data include information on budgets, gross income, genre popularity, and audience ratings among others.  In this project we have cleaned, mapped, and analyzed movie industry data to understand the direction an upcoming movie production company should take to maximize profits and popularity.  For this project we have focused on general movie data from IMDB as well as movie budget and income data from 'The Numbers'.

For this project we have assumed Microsoft, a large technology company with an immense amount of capital, has decided to open a movie studio; we have prepared our analyses and recommendations accordingly.  Throughout this project we honed in on data that we believe answers the following for the tech giant:
<ul>
  <li>Amount of money to invest to receive the highest return on investment.</li>
  <li>Genre to invest in to receive the highest audience favorability and return on investment.</li>
  <li>Optimal time of year for movie releases.</li>
</ul>
