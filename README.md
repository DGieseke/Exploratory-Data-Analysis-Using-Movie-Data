# Analysis of Movie Industry Data

*Seamus Walsh and Daniel Gieseke  |  May 12, 2023*

## Overview
Media companies in the entertainment industry hold a wealth of movie data waiting to be analyzed.  These large amounts of movie industry data include information on budgets, gross income, genre popularity, and audience ratings among others.  In this project we have cleaned, mapped, and analyzed movie industry data to understand the direction an upcoming movie production company should take to maximize profits and popularity.  For this project we have focused on general movie data from IMDB as well as movie budget and income data from 'The Numbers'.

## Business Understanding
For this project we have assumed Microsoft, a large technology company with an immense amount of capital, has decided to open a movie studio; we have prepared our analyses and recommendations accordingly.  Throughout this project we honed in on data that we believe answers the following for the tech giant:
<ul>
  <li>Amount of money to invest to receive the highest return on investment.</li>
  <li>Genre to invest in to receive the highest audience favorability and return on investment.</li>
  <li>Optimal time of year for movie releases.</li>
</ul>

## Data Understanding
As we set out to explore relevant data, we imported several data sets from reputable media organizations and narrowed down our data sets by metrics we aimed to measure.  After importing data sets from Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, Box Office Mojo, and The Numbers, we chose sets from IM.DB and The Numbers.  We imported both data sets into pandas data frames, cleaned data to ensure numerical values were readable as integers, dropped null and messy data, and for several visualizations we merged the data frames to compare 'genre', 'budget', and 'return on investment' data.

## Data Analysis
For our analyses we sought to answer and hone in on the three topics mentioned above:
<ul>
  <li>Amount of money to invest to receive the highest return on investment.</li>
  <li>Genre to invest in to receive the highest audience favorability and return on investment.</li>
  <li>Optimal time of year for movie releases.</li>
</ul>

Below are visualizations that we believe shed light on these points.  For additional narratives and context, please see our jupyter notebook file.
